👋 Hi, I’m @jsonwangruxinc

👀 I’m interested in building performant backends and reliable infrastructure. 

🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Kubernetes. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects written in Go or Rust.

Go's simplicity, efficiency, and suitability for building reliable services makes me excited. I love its concurrency model, type system, and performance considerations.

I look forward to learning and using Go with all of you and improving together. If you're also interested in Go, I'd love to discuss and exchange ideas!  

My biggest dream is to someday write Go programs independently to help humans solve problems. That would be an incredibly fulfilling experience for me!

Thanks again everyone, let's progress together!
